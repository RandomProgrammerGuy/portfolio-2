                <p>I was born on May 28, 2005 in Shiraz, Iran; a city well known for its historic sites such as the persepolis and being the home of Hafez and Saadi, some of Iran's most reknown poets. I grew up in Iran, spending my childhood and teenage years there and studying upto 11th grade. I then moved to Poitiers, France; my current location. I am a programmer, pianist, composer, photographer and an artist that likes to find interesting and novel solutions for problems. I speak fluent Persian and English, near-fluent French and a tad bit of Arabic.</p>
